    %\input{key_features}

    From the point of view of a user, what can you do with it?
    The primary user, for the purposes of this paper, is assumed to be:
    - Someone interested in using TudatPy in a way similar to that of a TU Delft Space instructor, so for education with a strong basis in research.

    Features to mention:

    Advantages / USPs to highlight:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modularity
        \item Fidelity
        \item Usability, particularly with the Python interface as well as how this allows the use of the vast range of Python tools now available (eg. Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...)
    \end{itemize}

    To do:
    \lbrack \rbrack As features are discussed, list published work (or educational settings) in which the various features have been applied.
