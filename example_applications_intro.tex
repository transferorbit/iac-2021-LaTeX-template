The aim for this section, and thus for the case studies (aka examples), is to have all of the cases focused on a single mission/dynamic scenario. The proposed scenario is to focus on a mission from Earth to an asteroid such as Itokawa. NB: A mission to this asteroid is the topic of the example application using PyGMO in the documentation, which can be found here:
