Why should someone choose to use TudatPy?
What are the main advantages of using TudatPy (eg. versus other packages â†’ without naming them (?) )?

Advantages / USPs to consider highlighting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modularity
    \item Fidelity
    \item Usability, particularly with the Python interface as well as how this allows the use of the vast range of Python tools now available (eg. Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...)
    \item Performance
\end{itemize}
